This repo is for distribution on [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can check out demos
in the [NG-Wakanda-Pack](https://github.com/Wakanda/NG-Wakanda-Pack/) repository.


## EXPERIMENTAL

THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE, AND ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT IS ONGOING. THE ANGULAR-WAKANDA CONNECTOR IS UNSTABLE AND NOT FINAL AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION (WHATEVER THAT MEANS FOR YOU).

*Fell free to test it for some upcoming project but be aware that it is still incomplete and its API is potentially subject to change.*

## Install

Install with [bower](http://bower.io):

```shell
bower install angular-wakanda
```

Add a `<script>` tag to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/angular-wakanda/angular-wakanda.min.js"></script>
```

Add `wakanda` as a dependency for your app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['wakanda']);
```

And finally use the `$wakanda` injected service:

```javascript
$wakanda.init().then(function (ds) {

	$scope.contacts = ds.Contact.$find();

});
```

## Configuration

You can use the `$wakandaConfig` provider to specify a different hostname than the default one which is `/`. *Do not include the final slash character.*

```
app.config(function($wakandaConfigProvider) {
  $wakandaConfigProvider.setHostname('http://127.0.0.1:8081');
}
```
